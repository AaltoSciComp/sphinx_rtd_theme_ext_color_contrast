name: PyPI release

# Make a PyPI release.  This action:
# - builds the release files
# - checks the tag version matches the source version
# - releases on PyPI using the action
#
# The first time, you have to upload the release yourself to get the
# API key, to add to gh-secrets.
#
# I upload it with:
#   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
#   twine upload dist/*
#
# To configure the secrets, see steps here:
#   https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish
#   secret name= pypi_password


# If MOD_NAME not defined, infer it from the current directory.  If
# inferred from the directory, '-' is replaced with '_'.  This is used
# when checking the version name.
#env:
#  MOD_NAME: numpy
