Sph

This increases some color contrast in sphinx_rtd_theme to better
satisfy web content accessibility guidelines.  This is by no means a
proper fix, but some quick hacks by an uneducated person.  It tries to
make minimal changes, though.

This package will be deprecated once sphinx_rtd_theme is good
upstream.
